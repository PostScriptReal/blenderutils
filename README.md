Target blender version: 4.0

# Features
## Materials
### Goldsrc
* Import images & setup nodes for materials (chromes are automatically set up too)
### Common
* Turn material between diffuse and matcap (with optional additive or transparent mode)
* EZ one stop shop for texture baking
* classic vertex weighting (hit shift+q in weight paint mode)
* keybind to toggle custom weight gradient (hit ctrl+shift+q)
### Edit mode
* In vertex menu: New option "vertex bones: make from selected" which will take the selected vertices, and make a proxy object & armature with said vertices rigged into bones controlled by the original mesh's vertices. Effectively allowing one to turn vertex animation into bone animation for goldsrc and others.

#  Installing & Updating
## Installing
Happens as any blender addon would, grab the master (not the release) as a .zip and slap it in blender
## Updating
The addon now includes automatic update checking. No need to hassle with that stuff anymore!
