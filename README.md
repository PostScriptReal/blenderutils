This happens the same way any other addon would, download this repo's master as a zip and slap it in blender.

### The lazier way
Extract zip to blender's script directory, overwriting any existing .py file from blenderutils, restart blender.
### The more complex way
Uninstall addon from blender, restart blender, install new zip to blender
